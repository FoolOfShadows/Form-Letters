Dear \(ptName),

To continue preserving your bone mass and strength I recommend weight bearing exercises and a calcium supplement such as Citrical, Oscal, etc. in the amount of 500 mg or 600 mg of calcium once a day and Vitamin D3, 1,000 IU daily.

If you have any further questions regarding the results of this test, please call my office to make an appointment to discuss them.

Sincerely,


Dawn R. Whelchel, M.D.

To increase your bone mass and strength and reduce fracture risk I recommend weight bearing exercises and a calcium supplement such as Citrical, Oscal, etc. in the amount of 500 mg or 600 mg once or twice a day.  Vitamin D has also been shown to decrease falls, improve strength and decrease fracture risk by 20%.  I suggest Vitamin D3, 1,000 to 2,000 IU daily.

We will discuss prescription treatment options at your next appointment to decide which is best for you.  Please call for an appointment if you do not already have one scheduled.
Sincerely,
